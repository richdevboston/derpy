    Notes: The yield to maturity (irr) calculation uses the numpy.irr library,
           which adopts a method that finds the root of a polynomial by solving
           the eigenvalue of the companion matrix. For a detailed explanation,
           please see http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/Spring17/Eigenvalue-Polynomials.pdf

           There are other faster, and generic ways to solve for the root of polynomial.
           i.e. the Newton-Raphson method. For an example of YTM calculation using this
           method please see http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/Spring17/Eigenvalue-Polynomials.pdf
